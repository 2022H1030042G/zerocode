## REST BDD - ZeroCode Testing Framework
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/authorjapps/zerocode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/authorjapps/zerocode)

Execute your complex business scenario steps with simple jsons which defines your RESTful service behaviour

### Easy! Simple! Readable! JSON Based!

#### Define a Scenario with [Given, When, Then] Steps, Then Run. See examples next to the table

#### Place holders for End Point Mocking

| Place Holder  | Output        | More  |
| ------------- |:-------------| -----|
| /$MOCK       | Signifies that this step will be used for mocking end points | Start with a front slash |
| $USE.WIREMOCK      | Framework will use wiremock APIs to mock the end points defined in "mocks" section | Can use other mechanisms e.g. local simulators |

#### General place holders

| Place Holder  | Output        | More  |
| ------------- |:-------------| -----|
| ${RANDOM.NUMBER}       | Replaces with a random number | Random number is generated using current timestamp in milli-sec |
| ${RANDOM.STRING:10}       | Replaces a random string consists of ten english alpphabets | The length can be dynamic |
| ${RANDOM.STRING:4}       | Replaces with a random string consists of four english alpphabets | The length can be dynamic |
| ${STATIC.ALPHABET:5}       | Replaces with abcde ie Static string of length 5| String starts from "a" and continues, repeats after "z"|
| ${STATIC.ALPHABET:7}       | Replaces with abcdefg ie Static string of length 7| String starts from a"" and continues, repeats after "z"|

#### Assertion place holders

| Place Holder  | Output        | More  |
| ------------- |:-------------| -----|
| $NOT.NULL       | Assertion passes if a not null value was present in the response | Otherwise fails |
| $NULL      | Assertion passes if a null value was present in the response | Otherwise fails |
| $[]       | Assertion passes if an empty array was present in the response | Otherwise fails |
| $GT.99       | Assertion passes if a value greater than 99 was present in the response | Can be any int, long, float etc |
| $LT.99       | Assertion passes if a value lesser than 99 was present in the response | Can be any int, long, float etc |
| $CONTAINS.STRING:can not create       | Assertion passes if the node value conatins string "can not create" in the response | Otherwise fails |

#### Assertion Path holders

| Place Holder  | Output        | More  |
| ------------- |:-------------| -----|
| $<path.to.array>.SIZE       | Assertion passes if the array size matches with value | See usage in the test json |
